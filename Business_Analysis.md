## Instructor Guidance

This is the first of the Activity assignments, based on the activities listed in 29148-2018. Read more about the activities and tasks in 29148 and the other standards cited in it. The best way to learn is by doing, so these assignments are designed to get you actively participating in the requirements engineering process.

You should start with a sponsor in mind, like a business or organization, not a project. A sponsor could be a department on campus, a student club or organization, a non-profit, a family business, or a corporation. To get the most out of this class you will need find a sponsor that is willing to work with you. If you cannot find one, let the professor know.

You are not expected to actually create a program for this class. In this class you will do all the things that need to be done before actually designing and building a program. Make sure the sponsor is aware of this.

You could choose to create software for the sponsor separate of this course as an internship, for service hours, for pay, or just to build your portfolio if you have the time and the interest. There is a possibility that you could continue to work with the sponsor you find now during your senior year when you will need to actually create software for a class.

## Additional Guidance

To create software that fills the needs of a client, you need to know their business. Sometimes, a person with a different role, like a business analyst, will do the majority of this work for a software engineer and just hand over a document like a Business Requirements Specification or Concept of Operations that tells you everything you need to know. Sometimes, like in this case, the software engineer needs to also do the work of a business analyst.

Incidentally, if you decide that you don't really like software engineering, you could still complete the degree program but instead get a job as a business analyst. The skills are pretty transferable.

Once you find a sponsor willing to work with you, first, do as much independent research about the business as you can. When you meet with them you want to impress them with your prior knowledge and not waste their time having to explain things to you that might be on their web site for example. Look below to see what kind of information you are expected to gather.

Next, have your first formal meeting with the sponsor to learn more about the business or organization. Confirm and clarify what you have learned through your independent research. Fill in any blanks and add to what you already have for the information you are expected to gather.

You should not have to create any of this information, your sponsor should be able to provide it or you should be able to discover it through research. It does not have to be totally complete. I know you are not an experienced business analyst. It should, however, reflect time, effort, research ability, critical thinking, and writing ability.

## Questions You Need to Answer

Although they will vary depending on the size and type of the business, the type of questions you need to answer include:

- What are the main objectives of the business?
- What results are you hoping to be obtained through or by new software? (MOST IMPORTANT) (keep it general and high level)
- How could it be proven that those results were obtained?
- By when do these results need to be obtained?
- What is the business model / How is the business mission achieved (how is money made / service provided)?
- Where is key business information stored? How is it stored and accessed? Who is responsible for the information?
- What are the major internal divisions of the business?
- What are the external entities associated with the business?
- How are the internal divisions and external entities interrelated?
- Is there a diagram describing the interrelation?
- What words have a special meaning within the business?
- What acronyms and abbreviations are used within the business?
- Who are the individuals or organizations that would have an interest in any software that might be developed? (users, customers, market analysts, regulators, software engineers, etc.)
- How will they influence the organization and business? (Who has decision-making authority?)
- How will they be related to the development and operation of the system? (Is there a team of developers already? Is there someone to train users? Is there someone to support a new system?)
- Do you have an organization chart?
- What laws and regulations govern the business?
- Is there a regulations handbook or something similar?
- What are the social responsibilities of the business?
- What is the technology base of the business (existing hardware and software, technical proficiency of employees, etc.)? (For example, it would be good to know if everyone uses an iPhone or if they already use AWS.)
