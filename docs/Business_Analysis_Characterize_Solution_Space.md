## Tasks

Define preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in life cycle stages.

Identify candidate alternative solution classes that span the potential solution space.

Assess each alternative solution class.

Select the preferred alternative solution class(es).

Research and meet with your sponsor again to learn more specifics about the business / organization and start to think about the solution broadly.

"The eventual system solution can be a new system, an evolution of an existing system or set of systems, an operational change to an existing system or set of systems, or some combination of these."  
29148-2018 6.2.3.4

Add to your existing Business Analysis Notes the questions you ask, the answers you are given, and the results of any additional research.

## Questions You Need to Answer

Although they will vary depending on the size and type of the business, the type of questions you need to answer include:

What policies will need to be followed?

What resources are available in developing a solution (people, hardware, software, money, etc.)?

What limitations or constraints exist related to developing a solution (hardware, software, money, time, personnel, materials)?

Ask again: Who are the individuals or organizations that would have an interest in the solution? (users, customers, market analysts, regulators, software engineers, etc.)

How will they influence the organization and business? (Who has decision-making authority?)

How will they be related to the development and operation of the system? (Is there a team of developers already? Is there someone to train users? Is there someone to support a new system?)

Work together to develop a description of the proposed system.

Does there need to be different modes of system operation?

What resources are available related to supporting the proposed system? (FAQ, help desk, etc.)

How will users/operators/maintainers interact with the system?

Which stakeholders should be engaged with?

Contracting issues (at least hypothetically)

Cost

Schedule

What design elements are important for the solution?

Is there a specific method of production that needs to be followed (certain methodology, software, languages, etc.)?

Who will do the verification that the solution meets requirements and is there a specific process you would like followed?

What will it look like when people start using the solution?

What support is available for when the solution is in use? (operating support, engineering support, maintenance support, supply support and training support)

Are there any requirements related to retiring the solution at the end of its life? Are there record retention policies?

What are the constraints to performing the project within cost and schedule?

### Preliminary Operational Concept of Proposed System

Under the **Business Structure** section, add the following.

#### Heading 1: Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary operational concept**  
Describe the proposed system in a high-level manner, indicating the operational features that are to be provided without specifying design details. As much as possible, include operational policies and constraints, modes of system operation, user classes and other involved personnel, and the support environment.

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary operational scenarios**  
Describe examples of how users/operators/maintainers will interact with the system in important contexts of use. The high-level scenarios are described for an activity or a series of activities of business processes supported by the system. The scenarios should be uniquely named and numbered.

---

### Preliminary Life-Cycle Concepts

Add a heading 1 for **Preliminary life-cycle concepts**

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary acquisition concept**  
Describes the way the system solution will be acquired including aspects such as stakeholder engagement, source of the solution, requirements definition, solicitation and contracting issues, design, production and verification.

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary deployment concept**  
Describes the way the system solution will be validated, delivered and introduced into operations.

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary support concept**  
Describes the desired support infrastructure and manpower considerations for supporting the system solution after it is deployed. A support concept addresses operating support, engineering support, maintenance support, supply support and training support.

Add a heading 2 for **Preliminary retirement concept**  
Describes the way the system will be removed from operation and retired, including the disposal of any hazardous materials used in or resulting from the process.

---

### Project Constraints

Add a heading 1 for **Project Constraints**

Describe constraints to performing the project within cost and schedule. (IMPORTANT)
