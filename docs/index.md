# CEN 3073 – Requirements Engineering & Analysis  
**Instructor:** Sudip Dhakal  
**Institution:** Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU)

This repository hosts the course website and instructional materials for **CEN 3073: Requirements Engineering & Analysis**.  
The course emphasizes a **standards-based, industry-aligned approach** to requirements engineering, grounded in **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148** and modern software engineering practice.

The website supports students through a structured, phase-driven project that culminates in the delivery of professional requirements artifacts.

## 📌 Course Focus

Students learn how to:
- Understand business problems **before** proposing technical solutions
- Elicit, analyze, model, verify, and manage requirements
- Produce professional requirements documents used in industry
- Work both **individually and in teams**, reflecting real-world practice

The course balances **team-based project work** with **individual accountability** through targeted assignments.

## 🧩 Project Structure & Deliverables

The semester-long project follows the requirements engineering lifecycle:

### Phase 1: Business Analysis
- **Deliverable:** Business Requirements Specification (BRS)
- Focus on business context, stakeholders, goals, and constraints

### Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation
- **Deliverables:** Use Case Diagram, Use Case Descriptions, User Stories
- Stakeholder interviews, discovery techniques, and scenario analysis

### Phase 3: Requirements Analysis & Reconciliation
- Conflict resolution, prioritization, and feasibility analysis
- Refinement of functional and non-functional requirements

### Phase 4: Requirements Modeling & Representation
- **Deliverables:** Refined system boundary, updated use cases, supporting models
- Emphasis on clarity, consistency, and traceability

### Phase 5: Requirements Verification & Validation
- Review for correctness, completeness, and testability
- Stakeholder validation activities

### Phase 6: Requirements Management
- Change handling, versioning, and impact awareness
- Lifecycle thinking beyond initial documentation

## 🧑‍🎓 Individual vs. Group Work

- **Group Project:** Students collaborate on a shared system throughout the semester
- **Individual Assignments:** Each student completes phase-aligned submissions
  to demonstrate personal understanding and accountability

This mirrors professional environments where engineers contribute individually within a team.

## 📄 Artifacts Produced

By the end of the course, students will have created:
- Business Requirements Specification (BRS)
- Software/System Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Supporting models (use cases, diagrams, user stories)
- Verification and validation documentation
