## Tasks

Analyze the problems and opportunities in the context of relevant trade-space factors.

Analyze customer complaints, problems and opportunities in the context of relevant trade-space factors.

Define the mission, business, or operational problem or opportunity.

Once you have learned about a business, you should be able to identify problems or opportunities for improvement. Sometimes stakeholders will be able to simply tell you the problem. Other times, they might describe a problem but not the real problem. The 5 Why's is a useful strategy in this situation. The goal for this activity is to define a problem that could be solved by software.

Working with your sponsor, identify the opportunity for developing a new solution, or improving a system-of-interest (SoI).

This must begin prior to starting the activities necessary to define stakeholder needs and requirements.

Add to your existing Business Analysis Notes the questions you ask, the answers you are given, and the results of any additional research.

#### Business operational policies and rules

Describe logical propositions applied in conducting the business processes. The propositions may be conditions to start, branch and terminate the sequence of the business activities in the business processes; criteria for judgment in the business processes; or formula to evaluate a quantity, which will likely be addressed in functional requirements in the SyRS and SRS. The policies and rules shall be uniquely named and numbered, and shall be referenced in the description of the business processes.

#### Business operational constraints

Describe conditions to be imposed in conducting the business process. The conditions may be on a performance constraint (e.g., the process shall be finished within a day after the triggering event occurs), or may be from a management requisite such as "every occurrence of the process shall be monitored and recorded".

#### Business operational modes

Describe methods to conduct the business operation in an unsteady state, for example, a state when business operations might be extremely busy due to some intensive occurrence of events. An unsteady state of business operation includes a manual operation mode when the proposed system is not available due to some unexpected situation like an accident or natural disaster.

Define the level of quality required for the business operation. For example, a business process may address required urgency with higher priority than the reliability of the business process.

An assumption is "a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof."
